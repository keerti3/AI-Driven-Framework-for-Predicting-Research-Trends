### üìñ Overview

An intelligent NLP and ML-based framework to analyze and forecast trends in scientific literature. Leveraging transformer models like **BERT** and tools like **BERTopic**, this project enables **topic modeling**, **weak signal detection**, and **trend forecasting** using **LSTM** and **ARIMA**. Designed to help researchers uncover emerging topics and interdisciplinary connections.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Requirements

- Python 3.7+  
- Jupyter Notebook

#### üì¶ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or install manually:
```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow transformers bertopic matplotlib
```
### üîó Data Sources
The project pulls literature data from the following trusted academic repositories:  
ArXiv ‚Äì Open-access repository for scientific preprints  
PubMed ‚Äì Biomedical and life sciences literature  
CrossRef ‚Äì Metadata for academic publications  

### üîê API Configuration
Before running the notebook, ensure your environment is configured with the necessary API keys.  
Create environment variables:  
```
export ARXIV_API_KEY=<Your_ArXiv_Key>
export PUBMED_API_KEY=<Your_PubMed_Key>
export CROSSREF_API_KEY=<Your_CrossRef_Key>
```
You can also place them in a .env file and load them with dotenv.

### üß™ Usage
To run the system, follow these steps:  
Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab  
Execute the cells in order to perform the following:

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Steps:
**1. Data Collection:**
Fetch research articles from ArXiv, PubMed, and CrossRef APIs  
**2. Data Preprocessing:**
Clean and normalize text using spaCy/NLTK  
**3. Topic Modeling:**
Use BERTopic + BERT embeddings for dynamic topic extraction  
**4. Weak Signal Detection:**
Identify low-frequency but volatile emerging terms using TF-IDF and contextual embeddings  
**5. Trend Forecasting:**
Train LSTM and ARIMA models on keyword usage to predict future research trajectories  
**6. Visualization:**
Plot term volatility, keyword evolution, and topic clusters

### üìä Results
The system identifies dominant research themes, weak signals, and future trends, enabling data-driven scientific exploration and strategic research planning.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
Data Quality: Depends on the availability and consistency of API data  
Compute Demand: Deep models like LSTM and BERTopic require high memory and processing power  
Model Complexity: Training can be time-intensive on large datasets

### üå± Future Enhancements
Integrate real-time literature feeds (RSS, CrossRef live)  
Add domain-specific tuning for biomedical or financial corpora  
Support streaming dashboards using Streamlit or Dash
