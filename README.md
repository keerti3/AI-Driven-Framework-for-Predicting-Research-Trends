## **Project : Advanced Text Processing for Scientific Literature Analysis**


### **Overview**
This project builds an intelligent NLP and ML-based framework to analyze and forecast trends in scientific literature. Leveraging transformer models like BERT and tools like BERTopic, it enables automated topic modeling, weak signal detection, and trend forecasting using LSTM and ARIMA. Designed to help researchers uncover emerging topics and interdisciplinary connections.

**Files**
Advanced Text Processing for Scientifc Literature Analysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing complete code for data collection, preprocessing, modeling, forecasting, and visualization.

### Installation Requirements
Python 3.7+
Jupyter Notebook

Install Dependencies
Install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or manually:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow transformers bertopic matplotlib
```
### Data Sources
ArXiv – Open-access scientific papers  
PubMed – Biomedical literature  
CrossRef – Academic metadata

API Configuration
Before running the notebook, export your API keys:
```
export ARXIV_API_KEY=<Your Key>
export PUBMED_API_KEY=<Your Key>
export CROSSREF_API_KEY=<Your Key>
```
### Usage
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Colab  
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions  
3. Data Collection (from ArXiv, PubMed, CrossRef)  
4. Preprocessing (tokenization, cleaning)  
5. Topic Modeling (with BERTopic + BERT)  
6. Weak Signal Detection (TF-IDF + volatility)  
7. Trend Forecasting (LSTM, ARIMA)  
8. Visualization (temporal plots of key terms/trends)

### Results
The system identifies dominant themes, emerging signals, and future research trends — enabling data-driven literature analysis and better research planning.

### Limitations
● Data Quality: Dependent on the completeness of fetched data  
● Compute Demand: Resource-intensive with large datasets  
● Model Complexity: Deep models may be time-consuming to train

### Future Enhancements
● Real-time data ingestion and updates  
● Scalable processing for large-scale literature  
● Domain-specific fine-tuning (e.g., biomedical, finance)
